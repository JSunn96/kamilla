                <h2>The Examination of the Borders of Representability </h2>
                                    <p style="width:80%;">
                                        My painting techniques require lengthy, in-depth work. In me, this has created a
                                        meditative-contemplative mentality of creation.
                                        This stance naturally reflected back on the treatment of the subject matter and
                                        directed
                                        my attention to perception beyond thoughts, emotions and physical reality, to
                                        the
                                        platonic world of ideas, the contemplation of layers of primordial existence
                                        unknowable
                                        by science.
                                        Today, modern technology makes it possible to <span id="demo" class="collapse">
                                            create an
                                            accurate and realistic rendering of the visible world, for example with the
                                            help of
                                            cameras or 3D printers.
                                            However, the invisible, hard to describe parts and spaces of our existence
                                            can not
                                            be given form with these tools, even if their exact image can be conjured in
                                            our
                                            minds, or if our imagination revolves around these and tries to pair to them
                                            a
                                            visual semblence.
                                            For this reason the free flow of a playful imagination and progressing in
                                            harmony
                                            with randomness and contingencies is of cardinal importance in my attitude.
                                            As the starting point of visibly rendering the intangible, I chose the
                                            incidental.
                                            My topic is the process of creation which is not directer by the painter,
                                            but the
                                            material. The process is based on the interaction between oil and water.
                                            After the
                                            first layer has dried I highlight the materials beauty with meticolous work.
                                            While
                                            concentrating I notice repeating patterns and the regularities of the
                                            eventually
                                            moving material. Repetition can be discovered in the seemingly chaotic
                                            spatters of
                                            paint on canvas, just as in the intricacy of nature.
                                            It is observable that the forming shapes evoke the visuality of the micro-
                                            and
                                            macrocosmos, which are the rythmic recurrences of a unified system in
                                            different
                                            magnitudes. My paintings may remind the viewer of the recordings of the
                                            Hubble Space
                                            Telescope, topographical maps, or even microscopical photos of bacteria.
                                            My working method is rooted in the philosophy of the Taoists, who believe
                                            that one
                                            should not resist against the forces which keep the world in constant
                                            movement, but
                                            adjust one's actions accordingly and thereby live in harmony with it,
                                            completely
                                            giving oneself over to the flow of Tao.
                                            The reason for my attitude is my desire for my paintings to shed them being
                                            bound to
                                            earth.
                                            I classify my work as aleatoricistism, which employs chance and regards it
                                            as its
                                            foundation. Incidentality tells about the ungraspable and inscrutable nature
                                            of
                                            existence, a phenomenon which can be physically described yet at the same
                                            time is
                                            inexplicable.</p>
